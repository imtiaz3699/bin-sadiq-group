the affected, partaking in recuperation projects for needy families. Another venture included
funding the seeds of hope package for providing to farming families so that they are able to
sustain with an estimated income of one year. Furthermore, our employees donated one day
salary for the noble cause. The material and financial support constituted food packages,
clothes bundles, principal medicines, home necessities, and rehabilitation substance for
schools. Afflicted families situated in KPK and Southern Punjab, struggling to rebuild their lives
were facilitated-areas including Kalam, Swat and Taunsa Sharif, Punjab.</p>

spreading the word via social media campaigning, record keeping and designing. The
intermediate phase involves the development of ration packages and their followed

incorporate all the vital grocery products for household consumption too, validating well-earned
virtues of the Holy Month.</p>
